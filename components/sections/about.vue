      About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hey! I’m Bryan — a frontend developer from Toronto with 7 years of experience making the web a more beautiful and functional place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love working on bringing designs to life, whether it’s a sleek marketing site or a full-on web application. I'm the kind of dev who notices when a button is off by 2 pixels — and then fixes it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work, you’ll probably find me strategizing in the latest board games, singing at BMO Field, or just deep-diving into the latest frontend tools.
