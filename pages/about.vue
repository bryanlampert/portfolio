            I play and watch any sport though I soccer and hockey will always be my first choice. <br /> <br />
            I also like to keep active and play various sports throughout the year. 
            In the summers I play outdoor competitive soccer and softball. 
            During the cold weather months I play indoor co-ed 6's soccer as well as beach volleyball.
