            I love to play board games of all styles, though I lean heavily towards strategy games. <br /> <br />
            Some of my favourite games in no particular order include:
          </p> 
          <ul>
            <li>Terra Mystica</li>
            <li>Agricola</li>
            <li>The Castles of Burgundy</li>
            <li>Suburbia</li>
            <li>7 Wonders</li>
            <li>Viticulture</li>
            and many more!

          <p>
            I play and watch any sport though soccer and hockey will always be my first choice. <br /> <br />
            I also like to keep active and play various sports throughout the year. 
            In the summers I play outdoor competitive soccer and softball. 
            During the cold weather months I play indoor co-ed 6's soccer as well as beach volleyball.

          <span class="subtitle t-6 has-text-primary">Toronto FC</span>
          <p>
            I am extremely passionate about Toronto FC. <br /> <br />
            You can find me in the stands at BMO Field singing, chanting and cursing all game long. <br /> <br />
            I am a season ticket holder as well as a member of the Red Patch Boys.
